## Introduction

This is the official implementation of the core code of [LeafMask paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.03568).

We validate our LeafMask through extensive experiments on Leaf Segmentation Challenge (LSC) dataset. Our proposed model achieves the 90.09% BestDice score outperforming other state-of-the-art approaches.
